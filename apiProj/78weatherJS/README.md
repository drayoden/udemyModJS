# Keeping my api keys secret

Starting back in the GithubFinder app I successfully used fetch to open
a local.json file (.gitigore) and set the value of the apiKey. 

For some reason, I am unable to repeate this. I am completely baffled and have been going around and around without any resolution. So, I have changed to creating a local.js with a simple class that holds a single attribute; the apikey. Go figure.
