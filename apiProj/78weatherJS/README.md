# Keeping my api keys secret

Starting back in the GithubFinder app I successfully used fetch to open
a local.js file (.gitigore) and set a constructor attribute in the Github class to the api key. 

Not, for some reason, I am unable to repeate this. I am completely baffled and have been going around and around without any resolution. So, I have changed to creating a local.js file (.gitignore) and exporting a variable with the api key. I then import it in the Weather
class constructor.
