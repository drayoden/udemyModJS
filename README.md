## Udemy - Modern JS From the Beginning

Some terms I always forget:

+ Ajax - Asynchronous JavaScript with XML  *(XML is not used anymore (rarely); JSON is now used)*

+ XHR - XmxHTTPRequest object  *(use fetch, async, await now)*

+ jQuery - Big bloated DOM manipulation lib  *(not recommended, all DOM work can be done with native JS)*
    
+ REST - Representational State Transfer  *(relies on stateless, client-server protocol; almost always HTTP)*
